CSE 3310 Intro to Software Engineering Android App

Term Project Objective: Practice general Software Engineering life cycles of Specification, Design, Implementation and Testing via programming an Android application. This class will be utilizing a Plan-driven Software Engineering approach and not an agile methodology.

Required Progress & delivery: Your project will be delivered in 4 increments as listed below:

Inc 1. UML diagrams: Due 9/30/21 in class (hardcopy, one per team) -- COMPLETE

Inc 2. SRA document (UML + detailed requirements): Due 10/28/21, one per team; Submit hardcopy of SRA in class. (note: Design and implementation should begin right after the midterm, there will an android training right after midterm) -- COMPLETE

Inc 3. Test Plan Doc. (hardcopy, one per team Due 11/18/2021 in class) + Peer reviews (Individual, hardcopy Due 11/16 or 11/18 in class depending on your group date that you are present in class). -- COMPLETE

Inc 4. Final product demo and course binder: Due 12/7/2021 (Final product: i.e. Project demo, source code, test plan and external documentation also referred to as user manual. Details of what to hand in will be provided in class later). Team presentations will take place during the last two weeks of the class. All students must present a portion of their project (i.e. UML, Requirements, and Test plan and project demo). Refer to class schedule for presentation schedule and details. -- COMPLETE

Assumptions:

All users are over the age of 18 and a current UTA student
Application initially free, advertisers pay for add space
You could charge the restaurants a small percentage (e.g. 10%) for ordered deliver via your app
Ignore any legal or tax issue unless you decide to make profit from your project
Ignore Post project maintenance issues
Project 1: University Food System (UFS)

Develop an android application to help university students order food and provide information about on-campus and near-campus restaurants and food providers (e.g. restaurant review and comments). The system should have an appealing home screen and minimally include the following functionality (you may modify or add additional functionality after receiving approval from your client):

Registration: Students must register before they can use the system. University ID can be used as member Id.

Login: Members must login to use the system after initial registration.

Payments: System should be able to handle payments (Meal plan and Credit cards only; You do not need to validate credit cards for this project, just make them 16 digits long, have an expiration date, and a 3-digit security code)

Restaurants: System should allow vendors to add their restaurants and their menu (e.g. subway, Panda express, connection café and other on campus restaurants).

Orders: Place food order (e.g. Sandwich and coke with chips etc.). System should also allow for modifying your order after the initial placement within 5 minutes of your initial order time (i.e. cancel an order to modify existing order by adding new items).

Communication: System should allow for sending text messages/e-mails to a single, subgroup or all members (e.g. Your order has been placed, your order is on its way etc.)

Delivery: System should allow students to track their order and get their food delivered or select an option for pick up.

Favorites list: Allow creating a favorite list of restaurants (you must have ordered at least once from a restaurant before you can add it to your favorite’s list)

Search: You should be able to search for different food items or restaurants

Review and Rating: Use Stars (one to five stars) to rate the service received, and allow to enter for a short comment to help future users

Advertisements: System should provide advertising space (e.g. Local subway store offers specials or coupons to members). This could be a source of revenue from the app.
